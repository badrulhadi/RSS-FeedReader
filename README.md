###Summary

This is a mini project for applying a Junior Application Developer position at Configura.

####Project background

This Project is written in html, css and javascript. It is a very simple RSS feed reader app that takes input in form of rss feed link and display the value as title of article with hyperlink.

All the logic/magic happen in index.html. The CSS and JS directory is only for Bootstrap and Jquery.

####Challanges

- First, I don't know how RSS feed works. So need to learn about that first. 
- I'm in a dilema to choose programming language to write this project. I'm mostly proficient with PHP and Javascript. I decided to write this project in Javascript just because it is easier to deploy (github pages) and give people easy access to try in online.
- When writing the code to request/fetch the feed, it doesn't work. I encountered with CORS error. I don't know what is that thing. It took a while before I find a way to by passed that.
